These are the specifications for the Macintosh case screws.

**Compact Mac Case Top**
* Screw, Tap, M 4.22 x 1.41* x 16, Torx, Zinc
* Apple P/N: 426-1007

NOTE: The replacement screw pitch is a more typical 1.46.  This
doesn't affect threading at this screw's length and was a lot cheaper
than custom tooling.

**Compact Mac Case Bottom**
* Screw, Tap, 8-32 x .625, Torx, Blk Zinc Oxide
* Apple P/N: 435-5002
